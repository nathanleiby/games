# Todo

## Tasks

### Must

- [ ] Game loop
  - [ ] Victory!
    - [ ] Congrats on beating three- try out "endless" mode for a challenge
  - [ ] Fail a level
    - [ ] Try again?

### Should

- add tutorial / level 0 that makes it clear which sound each button makes
  - introduce 1 button, then repetition, then another.
    - beep.
    - beep beep
    - beep boop beep
    - beep beep boop boop
      - (add growing and shrinking buttons -- no harder just a sense of what might change)
    - beep boop boop beep beep
- add "bop" - 3rd button
- interaction challenges
  - moving targets
    - left to right
    - circular paths
  - multiple copies of sound makers
  - size changing
    - growing and shrinking
    - shape changes (square -> rect squishes -> maybe circle ..)
  - uncertain targets
    - all turn white (cant tell which is which), then turn back
    - all turn black (invisible), then turn back

### Could

- ## nice background audio to support the beeps and boops
- nice background image
  - (learn) perhaps use a shader for a shifting background
    - https://excaliburjs.com/docs/postprocessors/#custom-shader-based-post-processors
- "hint" mode - show the sequence at top of screen so you don't have to memorize or hear it
- "endless" mode - generated challenges that get harder and harder
