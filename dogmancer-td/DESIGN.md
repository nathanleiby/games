# Design

Concept: Dungeon-defenders with Dog Wizards
Other inspiration: factorio, overcooked, Dungeon of the Endless

enemies have clear entry points. march toward tower

hero focused (e.g. shiba, etc .. "unholy alliance" expansion pack where cat-mancers join dog mancers?)

Battle has build phase and combat phase

Heros can:

1. build towers
2. "fuel" the towers (need potions, magic, belts)
3. hero can also do direct combat

Camera

- top down or side view (platformer)? -> top down makes for easier pathing
- single screen game

Supports Couch Co-op for 2p

Progression

- new armor, weapons, spells, tower-mods
- rogue lite aspect? do a "run"? (think Dungeon of the Endless)
  - this lets upgrades be more wild

# Principles

- players should not be identical. each player has a unique speciality, driving specialization and interlocking responsibilities

# Dreaming

- might each player have access to a limited region of map for build, so they need to coordinate? (overcooked inspire)
  - e.g. if p2 doesn't build a tower, enemies might slip into p1's area?
- might you choose 2 (character + role),
  - ... where the character and role interact in some way?
  - ... where character is cosmetic and role is functional?
  - e.g. character: shiba, corgi, husky
  - e.g. role: builder, fighter, wizard
- metagame -- world map? defend territory overall?
- upgrade heroes
- cute outfits for dogs (e.g. various robes, crowns)
- joke -- toggle "light/dark mode" to flip between controlling cats/dogs and defending against dogs/cats
